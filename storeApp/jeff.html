			<h1>Shop for Aerial Silks</h1>
			<img class="back" src="img/silks.png.jpg">  
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Voltige aerial silks have a low stretch and are narrow. At 1.4m wide these relatively narrow aerial fabrics are a bit easier to climb and wrap than our silks, especially for smaller aerialists and children. The low stretch makes these silks marginally better for beginners.</p>

			<h1>Shop for Aerial Straps</h1>
			<img class="back" src="img/straps.png.jpg">  
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Aerial straps are made from a strong cotton or nylon webbing and come in a variety of lengths, from 3m long to 10m long. Aerial straps can come with or without the loops at the end, however all the straps we stock have them. Like all our aerial kit, we only stock from the best names so you’ll find straps from the likes of Barry and Voltige on our shelves. We also stock all the rigging accessories you’ll need such as a hanger for aerial straps and a selection of swivels and carabiners.
    		This type of aerial apparatus requires a lot of strength and resembles aerial, or gymnastic, rings. Because of this it tends to be a male dominated discipline. Many aerial straps acts pre-1972 were very static with performers moving up and down the straps.</p>

			<h1>Shop for Aerial Hoops</h1>
			<img class="back" src="img/hoop.png.jpg">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Most of our rings are made from steel tubing but we also have solid steel rings for those who want an heavier aerial hoop. Our 95cm one-point aerial ring is by far our most popular model and is a good size for most female routines.
    		A general rule to find the right size hoop for you is to sit on a chair, and measure from the seat to the top of your head. Then add 10cm to that measurement.</p>
